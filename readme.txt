A simple way to embed the bbpress forum into your WordPress theme.

== Description ==

technically, this plugin was built for embeding the external home page of BBpress, after the installation, in the easiest way i could think of. However, because the method is so simple, one can use it for embeding any HTML page he wants.<br/>

note: the purpose was the ease of use, and not elegancy. we could made it more complicated by trying to force the forum to have the site template or something like this. but we didn't.

== Installation ==

Installtion is simple:

1. Upload the directory 'embed-bbpress' to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Setting is also simple:

1. Go to "Embed-BBpress" tab in "Plugins" menu.
2. Choose URL, width and height of the embeding window.
3. Edit a new page or post, and insert the shortcode [Embed-BBpress] in the prefered location.

That's it. your good to go.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Q: What about the width of the bbPress source style? how can i fit in intow my naarow main content of the theme?
